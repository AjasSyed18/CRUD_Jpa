Create:POST
Read:GET	
Update:PUT/PATCH
Delete:DELETE
without using any database by using an in-memory database like H2

Import the project into your IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA).
Create Entity Class:

Create Repository Interface:

Define a repository interface in src/main/java/com/example/demo.
Create Service Class:

Create Controller Class:

Define a REST controller in src/main/java/com/example/demo.
